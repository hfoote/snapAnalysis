# snapAnalysis
An N-body simulation snapshot analysis package. snapAnalysis is still under active development, and may still be missing planned core functionality. Documentation forthcoming. 

### Installation
0. I recommend installing snapAnalysis inside a virtual environment. If you already have one set up, activate it before cloning this repo. Otherwise, create a virtual environment with
```bash
python -m venv --system-site-packages </path/to/virtual/env>
```
then activate it 
```bash
source </path/to/virtual/env>/bin/activate
```
and upgrade pip if needed
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hfoote/snapAnalysis.git
```

2. Install with pip:
```bash
python -m pip install .
```
